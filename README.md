Mvc demo code
=====
This is a basic mvc demo, coded with education purpose. It does have some structural problems and
it should not be used in production.

If you want to test it you can clone this repository and call the url /meumodulo or /meumodulo/index/index.

This mvc demo assumes that the application will be constructed with modules and the url is mapped like:

:module/:controller/:action. You don't have the ability to pass more parameters to the request in a good way.

The demo uses "index" as default value for controller and action. Module are always request and doesn't have a default value.
